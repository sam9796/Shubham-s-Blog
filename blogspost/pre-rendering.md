# The Power of React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized the way we manage state and side effects in React applications. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks provide a more concise and functional way to handle complex logic and stateful behavior.

## Introduction to React Hooks

Traditionally, class components in React were used for managing state and lifecycle methods. With the advent of Hooks, developers can now use functional components and still leverage stateful features.

### useState Hook

One of the most commonly used hooks is `useState`, which allows us to add state to functional components. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
